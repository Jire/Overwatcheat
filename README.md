**Beginner's Guide**

Before doing anything, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.

The first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.

* Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jire/Overwatcheat)
* Click on the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Jire/Overwatcheat/releases) tab
* Download the latest release ZIP archive
* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example)
* Make sure you have Java Development Kit 19 or later installed
* Double click on the "_build_" (_build.bat_) script and wait for it to complete

Once those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_
directory, and will in a directory called **Overwatcheat 5.0.0**.

From within the **Overwatcheat 5.0.0** directory, you can start the cheat by running the _"Start Overwatcheat 5.0.0"_
script.

**Requirements:**

* Use fullscreen windowed mode if not using OBS projector
* It is vital to configure sensitivity to be the same as your in-game sens
* Increasing sensitivity to beyond your sens will give you slower aim
* Increasing FPS will increase accuracy
