The default settings are for Overwatch (settings and values), adjust the window title to your obs preview or something.

**Available Features**
* Incredibly efficient frame grabber
* Optimized zero-garbage frame pixel scanner
* Extremely low CPU and memory usage, with minimal effect on FPS
* Red-pixel HP bar aimbot

**Added Features**
* Settings work as the same way as Charlatano's settings (check out [Jire's Charlatano repository!](https://github.com/Jire/Charlatano/))
* Customizable triggerbot (with max x and y offsets)
* You can also use Color ratio instead of only one color

**Beginner's Guide**

Before doing anything, make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed.

The first step is to compile the source code into a usable cheat program.

* Visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lonerw0lf/Pixelaimbot)
* Click on **Clone or Download** tab
* Download by clicking Download Zip
* Extract the contents from the archive to any folder (to your desktop, for example)
* Make sure you have Java Development Kit 8 or later installed
* Double click on the "_build_" (_build.bat_) script and wait for it to complete

Once those steps are complete, the usable cheat program can be found within the _build_
directory, and will in a directory called **PixelAimBot 1.0.0**.

From within the **PixelAimBot 1.0.0** directory, you can start the cheat by running
the _"PixelAimBot 1.0.0"_ script (Windows Batch file).

Before starting the cheat, you should use fullscreen windowed mode!

Make sure to check the settings folder if you want to edit things, also if you cannot copy the window's title, get a program like Windows Title Changer, select the window (or process if it does not show up) and copy the title.
